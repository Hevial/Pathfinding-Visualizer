# Pathfinding Visualizer

A dynamic and interactive tool to visualize pathfinding algorithms in action. This project demonstrates how popular algorithms like Dijkstra, A*, BFS, and DFS solve the shortest path problem in grid-based environments. Additionally, it features maze generation algorithms to create interesting scenarios for testing. It is designed to be both educational and visually appealing.

## Algorithms

### Pathfinding Algorithms

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**  
  Guaranteed to find the shortest path, but explores all possible options.  

- **A***  
  A heuristic-based algorithm that efficiently finds the shortest path by prioritizing nodes with the lowest cost.  

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
  Explores nodes level by level. Ideal for unweighted graphs.  

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
  Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Not guaranteed to find the shortest path.  

### Maze Generation Algorithms

- **Recursive Division**  
  Splits the grid recursively to create a maze with complex paths.  

- **Binary Tree**  
  Generates a simple yet structured maze using a binary tree approach.
